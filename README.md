## Inspiration

Took consideration of daily utility and the theme of ocean conservation from the event Makeathon II hosted by UGA Hacks. Made with the desire to spread environmental awareness through actions such as shopping.

## What it does

Gathers clothing material data from ```uniqlo.com``` which is a fast fashion brand. Using the materials the specified clothing consists of, calculates the amount of microplastics that will be contributed to the ocean.

Data is divided into sections showing the impact from the purchase and wash cycles later in the future.

## Building the Project

This google extension was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Puppeteer, which is a JavaScript library for web scraping.
